## 2. Site Overview

Pulau Chebeh is a steep, sloping offshore island northeast of Tioman's main hub, renowned for its dramatic granite boulder formations and impressive underwater architecture. The site is split into north and south zones—each with distinct characteristics and chosen based on prevailing current direction. Chebeh's combination of dramatic topography, abundant coral growth, healthy fish populations, and accessible intermediate-to-advanced diving makes it a cornerstone site for Tioman.

- **Known for:** Massive granite boulder formations creating dramatic underwater landscape; excellent swim-throughs and overhangs; densely coral-covered rock faces (especially gorgonian sea fans and black corals); towering archways and rock-sheltered caverns; prolific schooling fish; sightings of turtles, sharks, barracudas, and occasional large pelagics.
- **Atmosphere:** Exploratory and visually rewarding; a "wild" reef setting that rewards careful observation and navigation; strong sense of scale and structure; energetic due to consistent current and fish activity.
- **Why dive here:** Advanced recreational and intermediate-plus divers appreciate the structural complexity and current experience; macro and wide-angle photographers find abundant subjects and dynamic lighting; the site is reliable for both fish life and geological drama; considered among the best offshore dives in Tioman.

***

## 3. Underwater Topography

- **Reef type:** Mixed rocky formation with dense coral overlay—primarily massive granite boulders and sloping rock faces densely covered in soft corals (gorgonians, black corals, sea fans) and hard coral colonies; sand/rubble channels between major formations.
- **Depth contour:** Steeply sloping site with boulder formations beginning at approximately 10 m on shallow flanks and descending to 25–28 m on deeper shelves. No wall-style cliff; rather, a steep tumble and terrace of massive boulders creating dramatic elevation changes within short horizontal distances.
- **Specific features:**
  - Large, jumbled granite boulders forming a complex three-dimensional maze.
  - Numerous swim-throughs, overhangs, and caverns throughout formations (smaller than Labas but still abundant).
  - **Pac-Man boulder** (north side, Chebeh North): A distinctive granite formation resembling the Pac-Man face, heavily encrusted in coral and positioned at current-edge; famous macro and schooling fish hotspot.
  - Gorgonian sea fans (particularly black corals and whip corals) densely covering rock faces, especially on deeper flanks.
  - Hard coral colonies in sheltered pockets and overhangs (plate, branching, and massive forms).
  - Sand and rubble channels separating major boulder clusters, hosting bottom-dwelling critters and serving as rest zones.
  - Two distinct operational dive zones: "Chebeh North" and "Chebeh South," chosen based on current direction on the day.
- **Key structures:** Massive boulder pinnacle/formation is the primary feature; divers explore around, through, and under boulders rather than following a linear slope. Depths shift significantly within a few metres of movement. Notable overhangs and ledges at 15–22 m range.

***

## 4. Typical Dive Profile

- **Entry method:** Giant stride from boat into open water; rapid descent along guide line or natural boulder edge to chosen entry depth (typically 12–15 m on sand or at base of rocks).
- **Route:** Route selection is guide and current-dependent. Divers typically approach from north or south depending on current set. Route involves weaving through boulder formations, ascending/descending around major structures, exploring caverns and swim-throughs, and navigating around the Pac-Man boulder (north site). Divers may circle specific formations or make a partial reef transect.
- **Typical depth range:** 12–20 m (main exploration); advanced divers extend to 22–28 m on deeper flanks.
- **Max recommended depth:** 28 m (in line with Advanced Open Water; experienced divers may extend slightly with adequate gas management).
- **Style:** Current-dependent drift or anchored exploration around boulders; divers may use rock formations as hold-points to manage current.
- **Duration:** 40–50 minutes typical bottom time; can extend to 60+ minutes depending on depth choice and diver air consumption.
- **Turnaround:** Ascent to shallower water (10–12 m) over final 5 minutes; safety stop (3–5 m) performed on shallow boulder feature or in open water with dependent buddy technique if current present.

***

## 5. Marine Life

- **Common species:**
  - **Schooling fish:** Dense clouds of yellow-striped snappers (especially around Pac-Man boulder and current-facing formations); schools of fusiliers; batfish; sweetlips; bigeye snapper.
  - **Reef fish:** Angelfish (large specimens); butterflyfish (schools); wrasse (including cleaning species); surgeonfish; parrotfish (including bumphead); pufferfish; triggerfish (including titan triggerfish).
  - **Elasmobranches:** Blacktip and Whitetip reef sharks (patrolling sand channels and sheltering under ledges); blue-spotted stingrays (occasionally on sandy flats).
  - **Sea turtles:** Green and Hawksbill turtles (resting in caverns, feeding on coral; sighted regularly in high season).
  - **Crustaceans:** Lobsters (on rock crevices); Spanner crabs; cleaning shrimp.
  - **Cephalopods:** Cuttlefish; octopuses (in crevices).
  - **Other macro fauna:** Scorpionfish (camouflaged on rocks); lionfish; nudibranchs (multiple species on rubble and rock crevices).
  - **Eels:** Moray and garden eels in cracks.
- **Occasional species:**
  - **Pelagics:** Great barracuda (schools); large trevallies (Jacks); occasionally giant trevallies.
  - **Large reef fish:** Humphead parrotfish (bumphead); large groupers.
  - **Seasonal megafauna:** Whale sharks (reported sightings during April–October migration windows, primarily April and October; very rare but documented at Chebeh); manta rays (occasional during seasonal upwelling months); mobula rays.
- **Rare encounters:** Rare sightings of larger pelagic species outside migration seasons.
- **Seasonal highlights:**
  - **April–June and September–October:** Peak visibility and most reliable schooling fish activity; turtle sightings most frequent; optimal conditions for large reef fish.
  - **March–May:** Post-monsoon recovery; excellent clarity; sharks and turtles common.
  - **June–August:** Summer season; visibility drops to 8–15 m but diving remains productive; fish life remains robust.
  - **April & October:** Documented whale shark migration periods; extremely rare opportunistic sightings possible.

***

## 6. Conditions

- **Visibility:**
  - **Best:** 20–30 m (March–June; peak March–May).
  - **Good:** 15–20 m (September–October).
  - **Moderate:** 8–15 m (June–August; summer season).
  - **Poor:** <10 m (November–February monsoon; diving limited).
- **Current:**
  - **Strength:** Moderate to strong; ranges from 0.5–1.5 m/s depending on tidal phase and monsoon period.
  - **Direction:** Influenced by open-water swell and monsoon direction; varies between north and south zones. North side (Chebeh North) and south side (Chebeh South) are dived on alternating days based on current set.
  - **Behavior:** Generally flows along/around the boulder formations; can create eddy zones on lee sides of large boulders (allowing drift-stop-resume style exploration); strong at exposed features (Pac-Man boulder experiences consistent current push).
  - **Quirks:** Current can shift mid-dive with tidal change; occasionally split into multiple directions at depth; best managed by using boulder formations as hold-points.
- **Surge/Swell:**
  - Low-to-moderate at depth (protected by boulder formation).
  - Surface surge varies with monsoon phase; can be 1–2 m during high swell (especially October–February approach).
- **Temperature:** 27–30 °C year-round; consistent tropical water.
- **Triggers:**
  - **Tidal phase:** Slack water (1–2 hours around slack high tide) provides easiest diving; ebb/flood tides intensify current.
  - **Monsoon phase:** Northeast Monsoon (November–February) weakens visibility and increases surface chop; Southwest Monsoon (June–August) is milder.
  - **Seasonal upwelling:** May–October can bring nutrient-rich cooler water, enhancing visibility and fish activity.

***

## 7. Difficulty Assessment

- **Skills required:**
  - Solid buoyancy control (essential for managing depth and current around boulders).
  - Current-aware navigation (ability to use formations as rest points; understand drift behavior).
  - Moderate-depth comfort (20+ m requires solid equalization and air management).
  - Spatial orientation in complex terrain (swim-through navigation without claustrophobia).
  - Comfortable with moderate surface swim (entry/exit in open water; possible current at surface).
- **Challenges:**
  - **Current management:** Moderate-to-strong current demands respect and technique; divers unfamiliar with current work may feel rushed or use excessive air.
  - **Navigation complexity:** Boulder maze can disorient less-experienced navigators; easy to lose depth awareness or get turned around.
  - **Depth range:** Deeper flanks (22–28 m) approach recreational limits; nitrogen narcosis and air consumption become factors.
  - **Visibility variability:** Low-season visibility (June–August) reduces visual reward and can stress less-confident divers.
  - **Entry/exit dynamics:** Open-water entry/exit with possible current requires confident surface swimming.
- **Beginner notes:** Not recommended for OWD/newly certified divers. Intermediate divers (20–50 dives) with current experience can safely enjoy north/south shallow zones (10–18 m) under guide leadership. Deeper zones (20–28 m) require AOWD or equivalent confidence.
- **Not suitable for:** Open Water–only divers or divers without experience in moderate current and depths beyond 18 m.
- **Advanced notes:** Advanced divers (AOWD+) can exploit full depth range and current dynamics for efficient exploration; macro photographers find excellent lighting and diverse critters; current dive is rewarding for those comfortable in blue-water drift.

***

## 8. Recommended Diver Profile

- **Certification:** AOWD or equivalent minimum; Advanced training (AOW, AOWD) strongly preferred. OWD/recently certified unsuitable due to current and depth combination.
- **Min dive count:** 20–30 dives recommended minimum; 50+ ideal. Divers with specific current and deep-diving experience (from other regions) may succeed with 15+ dives if guided and attentive.
- **Comfort level:**
  - Comfortable managing moderate-to-strong current (ability to "park" against formation, understand drift).
  - Confident equalizing below 15 m.
  - Capable of measured-pace navigation without anxiety in complex reef terrain.
  - Able to make calm gas-management decisions at 20+ m depth.
  - Comfortable with open-water surface swims and entry/exit procedures.

***

## 9. Hazards & Safety Notes

- **Physical hazards:**
  - **Current:** Moderate-to-strong flow around formations; can surprise or exhaust less-current-experienced divers. Always plan for current; dive slack water when possible; use boulder formations as rest points.
  - **Entanglement:** Limited entanglement hazard due to open boulder structure (no heavy kelp, sponges, or wreckage), but loose areas of coral/gorgonian can catch equipment if careless.
  - **Depth and decompression:** Deeper flanks (22–28 m) require air consumption awareness; no decompression required on typical sport dives but margins are tighter.
- **Depth risks:**
  - Sudden depth transitions (rock ledges drop 5–10 m over short horizontal distance); easy to descend unintentionally.
  - Nitrogen narcosis possible on deeper rambles (22+ m); manage depth profile and return to shallower water if disorientation occurs.
- **Surface risks:**
  - **Boat traffic:** Tioman marine park mooring system reduces risk, but operators must maintain boat awareness and ensure mooring lines are clear.
  - **Open-water entry/exit:** Brief exposed swim on entry/exit; no hazard in calm conditions, but chop or unexpected current can stress unprepared divers.
  - **Surface conditions:** Open-water ascents and boat pickup may involve surface current; delayed SMB deployment and controlled ascent procedures are required.
- **Environmental risks:**
  - **Surge/swell:** Low impact at depth; surface surge during monsoon (October–February) can make entry/exit uncomfortable.
  - **Visibility drops:** Low-season visibility (June–August) and monsoon season (November–February) can reduce visual reward and increase disorientation risk; stay closer to guide; use torches even in daytime.
- **Other hazards:**
  - **Corallivorous fish (triggerfish):** Occasional aggressive defense behavior if diver approaches nest; maintain respectful distance.
  - **Lionfish:** Present but not aggressive; no incident history; avoid hand contact.
  - **Sharks:** Blacktip/Whitetip reef sharks are skittish and non-aggressive; no incident history; normal behavior is avoidance.
- **Incidents:** No documented serious incidents. Site has excellent safety record when dived by trained operators and appropriate certification levels.

## 10. Photography Notes

- **Lens recommendation:** Mixed macro and wide-angle optimal; 60 mm macro for critters, 16–35 mm wide for boulder formations and schooling fish.
- **Focal length:**
  - **Macro (60 mm):** Scorpionfish, nudibranchs, crustaceans, small eels, cephalopods (typical subject distance 0.5–1 m).
  - **Wide-angle (16–35 mm):** Boulder formations, swim-throughs, large schooling formations around Pac-Man boulder, fish-filled caverns, soft coral gardens (typical subject distance 2–5 m).
- **Lighting:**
  - **Strobes:** Recommended for macro (critter detail, color saturation in low-season visibility). Wide-angle benefits from fill-flash on deep boulder areas (20+ m) where ambient light diminishes.
  - **Ambient light:** Excellent on shallow boulder faces (10–16 m) during high-season dive (morning dives with clear water). Deeper areas (20+ m) and low-visibility season (June–August) require strobes for color.
  - **Backscatter risk:** Moderate; avoid shooting toward light source when passing over sand/silt clouds. Use wide-angle framing to minimize suspended particle interference.
- **Subject tips:**
  - **Schooling fish:** Approach slowly; position wide-angle lens to frame school with boulder backdrop. Best at Pac-Man boulder (north site) and current-facing rock formations (morning light ideal).
  - **Critters:** Scorpionfish and nudibranchs abundant on rubble and rock crevices; shoot from 0.5–1 m with minimal movement to avoid spooking; use macro lens with focus light.
  - **Boulder formations:** Shoot upward from below to emphasize scale and overhang structure; position diver silhouettes for scale reference.
  - **Swim-throughs:** Enter slowly; position self to frame light at far end; silhouette foreground rock to enhance sense of enclosed space.
- **Best time:**
  - **High season (March–June):** Best visibility, color saturation, and fish activity; morning dives capture best ambient light on shallow formations.
  - **Shoulder season (September–October):** Good conditions; slightly less crowded than peak.
  - **Low season (June–August):** Visibility 8–15 m limits wide-angle appeal; macro still viable with strobes.
  - **Monsoon (November–February):** Poor visibility; not recommended for photography.
- **Challenges:**
  - **Variable visibility:** Low season and monsoon reduce water clarity; plan macro-heavy photo log if visiting June–February.
  - **Current:** Can make static composition difficult for wide-angle; use rock-parking technique to stabilize position.
  - **Depth:** Deeper zones (20+ m) lose color rapidly; strobes essential for color correction on deep boulder/fan coral shots.

## 11. Best Time to Dive

- **High season (March–June):**
  - **Best visibility:** 20–30 m (peak March–May).
  - **Conditions:** Calm to moderate sea state; consistent shallow-dive comfort; excellent fish activity.
  - **Why best:** Optimal light, color saturation, and visibility; most reliable for all diver types; peak turtle and shark sightings; touristically busiest period.
- **Shoulder season (September–October):**
  - **Visibility:** 15–25 m (good but slightly lower than March–June).
  - **Conditions:** Transition period; gradually shifting toward monsoon; occasional swell beginning October.
  - **Why good:** Fewer tourists than peak; still excellent diving; whale shark migration window (October especially).
- **Summer season (June–August):**
  - **Visibility:** 8–15 m (significantly reduced).
  - **Conditions:** Warm water; generally calm sea state; Southwest Monsoon (mild).
  - **Why diveable but challenged:** Visibility drop limits wide-angle photography and reduces visual reward; macro still excellent; fish life undiminished. Suitable for macro specialists and divers who enjoy current-heavy conditions.
- **Low season / Monsoon (November–February):**
  - **Visibility:** <10–15 m (poor; frequent <8 m days).
  - **Conditions:** Northeast Monsoon brings strong winds, swell, and rough surface; diving frequently cancelled.
  - **Why not ideal:** Most operators close or reduce schedules; unpredictable conditions; poor visibility; uncomfortable surface conditions. February marks monsoon exit (conditions begin improving); early February dives possible on calmer days but unreliable.

**Monthly summary:**

- **January:** Monsoon peak; most operators closed.
- **February:** Monsoon exit (late Feb improves); limited availability.
- **March:** Conditions improve rapidly; excellent visibility; high-season beginning.
- **April–June:** Peak season; best overall conditions.
- **July–August:** Summer; lower visibility but very warm; fewer tourists.
- **September:** Transition to shoulder season; good conditions.
- **October:** Excellent; whale shark migration window; early monsoon swell building.
- **November:** Monsoon onset; frequent cancellations.
- **December:** Peak monsoon; most operators closed.

***

## 12. Practical Tips

- **Timing:**
  - **Best time of day:** Early morning dives (first boat) provide calmest surface conditions and best ambient light for photography (if clear).
  - **Slack water:** Plan dives around slack water period (typically 1–2 hours around slack high tide) for easiest current management; ask operator for tidal prediction.
  - **Current windows:** If current unavoidable, dive during moderate (not peak ebb/flood) phase; allow extra bottom time for current-assisted drift if appropriately skilled.
- **Frequency:**
  - Chebeh is offered on most days by major operators (ABC-based dive shops run 1–2 charters daily when conditions permit).
  - Site is reliable and regularly dived; no shortage of guides familiar with topography.
  - Book directly with operator; no advance special request usually needed.
- **Cancellations:**
  - Chebeh is occasionally cancelled during monsoon (November–February) due to heavy swell or poor visibility.
  - Early monsoon (October–November) and late monsoon (January–early February) may see intermittent closures.
  - Rarely cancelled during dry season (March–October) unless extreme weather; current alone does not trigger cancellation.
  - Ask operator for cancellation policy and backup site options.
- **Gas choice:**
  - **Standard air:** Acceptable for recreational depths (10–20 m). Adequate for most dives.
  - **Nitrox (EANx32):** Beneficial if diving deeper (22–28 m) or making multiple dives in a day; extends bottom time and reduces nitrogen loading; popular with photo-focused divers. Not essential but recommended for advanced divers exploring full depth range.
  - **Deco/Tech gases:** Not applicable for recreational sport diving at Chebeh.
- **Exposure protection:**
  - **Wetsuit recommendation:** 3 mm neoprene (shorty or full suit) adequate year-round; 5 mm full suit recommended for extended dives (60+ min) or diver cold sensitivity.
  - **Water temp:** 27–30 °C year-round (tropical); hypothermia not a practical concern; wetsuit choice is comfort-based.
- **Drift management:**
  - If current present and drift required, maintain secure buddy contact and use rock formations as reference points and rest stations.
  - Ascent from drift dive requires careful buoyancy control and reference to formation or line (boat-assisted ascent if strong current and open-water ascent required).
  - Discuss current management plan with guide/operator pre-dive.

## 13. Example Dive Narrative

The boat releases you in clear, warm water over sand roughly 50 metres from the main boulder formation of Chebeh North. You descend alongside a guide along a natural slope, equalizing smoothly as depth increases. At 12 metres, the massive granite boulders appear through the blue—towering shapes festooned in brilliant orange and purple gorgonian fans and soft coral polyps. The current is moderate from the northeast, pushing gently but noticeably. You use the boulder face as an anchor, holding steady to observe the landscape. Yellow-striped snappers school in a tight formation overhead, their silhouettes flickering across the boulder lip. Your guide gestures toward a distinctive rock formation shaped roughly like a Pac-Man face (famous among local guides), encrusted in coral and alive with smaller fish huddled in its lee. You navigate slowly toward it, using buoyancy and brief hand-holds on the rock to manage the current. Around the formation, you spot a brilliant blue starfish and a small scorpionfish, perfectly camouflaged on the rust-colored rock. Your macro photographer guide signals for a closer look; you frame the scorpionfish against the coral backdrop as light refracts through the water above. After 15 minutes at the Pac-Man zone, your guide indicates it's time to move. You ascend slightly to 14 metres and drift-kick across a rubble saddle, pausing occasionally to inspect crevices. A small moray eel peers from a crack; a pair of spanner crabs skitter across open sand. Deeper, at 20 metres, you explore an overhang adorned with whip corals and black corals, their branches stirring gently in the current. A small school of juvenile barracudas darts past. You check your air gauge—50 bar remaining—and signal to your guide that you're ready to ascend. You return to the boulder formation and begin a gradual ascent to 8 metres over the final 5 minutes, pausing momentarily in the shallows where soft coral branches frame the view back into blue water. At 5 metres, you conduct your safety stop, floating in open water as smaller reef fish dart and circle. The dive ends as it began: a giant stride back to the boat, and a brief surface swim to the stern ladder. Forty-two minutes bottom time. Salt, sun, and the satisfaction of having seen a wild, beautiful reef.

- **Verification notes:**
  - **Depth range (10–28 m):** Consistent across all sources; 28 m represents deeper flanks mentioned in Scuba Travel Ventures ("30-plus meters" in narrative); 10 m confirmed as shallow-entry depth.
  - **Visibility:** March–June 20–30 m (Scuba Diving, TDB SunBeach, Tioman operators). June–August 8–15 m (summer season data from multiple operators). November–February <10 m (monsoon period consistent across sources).
  - **Current:** Described as "moderate to strong" in Scuba Travel Ventures and operator notes; varies by zone and tidal phase (consistent across all descriptions).
  - **Water temperature:** 27–30 °C (consistent across all Tioman-wide data; tropical constant).
  - **Marine life:** Specific species (barracudas, trevallies, snappers, turtles, sharks, gorgonians) mentioned across Scuba Travel Ventures, TDB SunBeach, DiveAdventures, and operator pages. Whale shark sighting documented in Facebook post (B&J Diving Centre; 7 m depth at Chebeh; April–October migration window). Spanner crabs, lobsters confirmed in TDB SunBeach and other sources.
  - **Pac-Man boulder:** Specific reference in Scuba Travel Ventures (Martin Ritter narrative) with precise details (north side, narrow swim-through, glass fish and juvenile barracudas). Confirmed as reliable feature across guides.
  - **Two zones (North/South):** Mentioned in Scuba Travel Ventures and operator references (choice depends on current direction).
  - **Difficulty/certification:** AOWD inferred from combination of depth (28 m max), current description, and site descriptions by professional sources. Intermediate divers mentioned as "suitable for all levels" in TDB SunBeach but cautioned with "advanced divers" reference in Scuba Travel Ventures (current management).

- **Inferences:**
  - **Min cert level code (AOWD):** Inferred from depth (28 m), current (moderate-to-strong), and source references to "advanced divers" at this site. Recreational depth limit for OWD is 18 m; current-diving at 20+ m logically requires AOWD or equivalent. Conservatively set as minimum; OWD with significant experience might dive shallow zones (10–18 m) under guidance.
  - **Difficulty rating (3 / 5):** Inferred from: depth (20+ m = above-intermediate), current (moderate-to-strong = challenging), topography (complex but not overhead/technical = intermediate-plus), and source descriptions of "suitable for all levels" with cautionary notes on current. Not a 2 (would be Renggis/beginner-zone sites). Not a 4–5 (would be deep technical or wreck-dependent). 3 = intermediate-to-advanced sweet spot.
  - **Drift diving description:** Mentioned in Scuba Travel Ventures as possible "drift-assisted" exploration but also stationary "formation-holding" dives; described as both drift and exploratory based on current/guide choice.
  - **Exposure protection (3 mm):** Inferred from year-round tropical 27–30 °C water and Tioman-wide operator recommendations (standard 3 mm for comfort); 5 mm suggested for extended bottom time (standard diving practice).
  - **Best dive time (March–June):** Supported by visibility data (20–30 m peak); March–May specifically highlighted in multiple sources as "best" for visibility and fish activity.

- **Gaps / Uncertainty:**
  - **Precise GPS coordinates:** Not provided in sources; would require operator contact or third-party mapping integration.
  - **Exact boat ride time from ABC:** Scuba Travel Ventures mentions "30–40 minutes by speedboat" from main hub; exact time variable with sea state and boat speed.
  - **Specific max depth on deeper flanks:** Sources mention "30+ meters" (Scuba Travel Ventures) and "28 m" (TDB SunBeach); used conservative 28 m as max-recommended recreational depth; actual bottom may be deeper.
  - **Frequency of whale shark sightings:** One Facebook anecdote (B&J Diving) confirms sighting at Chebeh; frequency not quantified. Described as rare in broader Tioman context; included as "occasional" in seasonal highlights with caveats.
  - **Specific mooring/entry point details:** Not provided; standard practice is boat mooring with giant stride entry (confirmed by guide narratives).
  - **Night diving availability:** Not mentioned in sources; presumably offered but not documented here.
