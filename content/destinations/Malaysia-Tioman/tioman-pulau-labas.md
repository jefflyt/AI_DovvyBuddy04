## 2. Site Overview

Pulau Labas (commonly referred to as "Labas Island" in English) is a small, uninhabited offshore island in the north-west of Tioman offering two distinct dive sites ("head" and "tail") separated by varying conditions. The site is renowned for its labyrinthine volcanic rock formations interspersed with abundant coral growth, creating a maze-like underwater environment with numerous swim-throughs, caverns, and crevices. It attracts divers seeking a more technical challenge than nearby beginner sites, with excellent opportunities for exploration, macro photography, and encounters with larger marine life.

- **Known for:** Distinctive volcanic rock formations; intricate swim-throughs and caverns (resembling "Swiss cheese"); lush soft coral coverage; excellent visibility during high season; encounters with sharks, turtles, and sizeable reef fish.
- **Atmosphere:** Exploratory and engaging; moderately challenging with good visual complexity; feels more "wild" than sheltered shallow reefs; rewards careful navigation and observation.
- **Why dive here:** Intermediate and advanced divers appreciate the structural complexity and depth options; macro enthusiasts find healthy populations of nudibranchs, lionfish, and crustaceans; the site offers stepping-stone progression from shallow beginner sites to deeper technical dives.

## 3. Underwater Topography

- **Reef type:** Mixed—primarily volcanic rock boulders and formations with soft coral patches and hard coral colonies in sheltered pockets; sand/rubble interspersed between major structures.
- **Depth contour:** Sloping site with rock formations beginning at approximately 10 m and descending to 20–24 m on deeper flanks. No sheer walls; rather, a tumble of boulders creating elevation changes and depth variation.
- **Specific features:**
  - Large jumble of volcanic boulders and rocks creating a complex, three-dimensional structure.
  - Numerous swim-throughs, caverns, and crevices throughout the formation (the "Swiss cheese" characteristic).
  - Soft coral gardens covering much of the rock surface (bright oranges, pinks, and purples reported).
  - Hard coral colonies in protected areas, including branching and plate corals.
  - Gorgonian sea fans interspersed among boulders.
  - Sand and rubble zones between major rock structures, hosting bottom-dwelling critters.
  - Two distinct dive site zones: "Head of Labas" and "Tail of Labas," chosen based on current direction and conditions on the day.
- **Key structures:** The pinnacle of rock formations is the primary feature; divers navigate through and around boulders rather than following a linear reef wall or slope. Depths vary significantly within a few metres of vertical movement.

***

## 4. Typical Dive Profile

- **Entry method:** Giant stride from boat into water; descent along guide line or natural feature to chosen entry depth (typically 10–12 m on sand or at base of rocks).
- **Route:** Navigation through the rock labyrinth is guide-dependent. Divers typically begin at the "head" or "tail" depending on current and conditions. The route involves weaving through swim-throughs, exploring caverns, and ascending/descending through the rock formation. Divers may make a partial circumnavigation or focused exploration of a particular zone.
- **Typical depth range:** 10–18 m (main exploration); advanced divers may extend to 20–24 m on deeper flanks.
- **Max recommended depth:** 24 m (in line with Advanced Open Water skills and site characteristics).
- **Style:** Stationary reef exploration with navigation through structures; current-dependent drift may occur on outer flanks.
- **Duration:** 40–50 minutes typical bottom time; can extend to 60+ minutes depending on depth choice and diver air consumption.
- **Turnaround:** Return to shallower water (10–12 m) for final minutes; ascent to 3–5 m safety stop performed on shallow rock feature or in open water.

## 5. Marine Life

- **Common species:**
  - Sea turtles (Green and Hawksbill; sighted resting in caverns or feeding on reef; seen regularly in high season).
  - Reef sharks (Blacktip and Whitetip reef sharks; sheltering under ledges and patrolling sand zones).
  - Angelfish (large specimens inhabiting soft coral patches).
  - Butterfly fish (schools among coral gardens).
  - Wrasse (including cleaning wrasses).
  - Surgeonfish and Parrotfish (reef residents).
  - Scorpionfish (camouflaged on rocks and rubble; common macro subject).
  - Lionfish (including zebra lionfish; frequent in crevices and lower profile areas).
  - Eels (Moray and garden eels in cracks; regularly spotted).
  - Nudibranchs (multiple species in crevices and on rubble; excellent macro subjects).

- **Occasional species:**
  - Barracuda (schooling or hunting in open water above rocks).
  - Stingrays (Blue-spotted; resting on sand between structures).
  - Jacks and Trevally (passing schools, especially in higher current days).
  - Batfish (in loose aggregations).
  - Pufferfish.
  - Sweetlips.
  - Stonefish (well-camouflaged; rare but present in rocky areas).
  - Frogfish (rare; muck-diving specialists may encounter them on sandy zones).
  - Banded Sea-Kraits (reported in Tioman area; infrequent).
  - Cuttlefish and Octopus (nocturnal or cryptic; occasionally spotted).

- **Rare encounters:**
  - Large Grouper species (e.g., Giant Grouper or Napoleon Wrasse; possible but uncommon).
  - Manta Rays (occasional visitors in strong current conditions).
  - Eagle Rays (passing through; infrequent).

- **Seasonal highlights:**
  - **March–June (High season):** Peak visibility and water clarity; increased pelagic activity; turtle sightings most frequent; Pharaoh Reef Cuttlefish mating season (reported in Tioman).
  - **February–October (Dry season):** Consistent diving conditions; marine life activity remains good.
  - **November–January (Monsoon):** Site typically closed; diving not permitted.

***

## 6. Conditions

- **Visibility:** Ranges from 10–30 m depending on season.
  - **High season (March–June):** 15–30 m typical; exceptional clarity.
  - **Low season (summer; July–October, and early February):** 8–15 m typical; acceptable but reduced.
  - **Monsoon closure (November–January):** Site not diveable.

- **Current:** Variable and can be moderate to strong. Direction depends on tide and sea state. Split currents or eddy effects possible around rock formations. Outer flanks more exposed to current than sheltered cavern zones. Current strength is one factor determining which dive site zone ("head" or "tail") is chosen by the operator on the day.

- **Surge/Swell:** Moderate exposure. Rock formations provide shelter from surge in cavern and crevice areas, but outer slopes may experience surge during rough surface conditions.

- **Temperature:** Consistently warm, 27–29 °C year-round; standard 3–5 mm exposure suit sufficient.

- **Triggers:** Monsoon window (November–January) closes the island to diving. Tidal cycle and moon phase influence current strength. Upwelling events (uncommon but possible) can temporarily reduce visibility. Heavy rain or swell from passing storms may trigger operator cancellations.

## 7. Difficulty Assessment

- **Skills required:**
  - Neutral buoyancy control (essential for navigating tight swim-throughs and caverns).
  - Spatial orientation and navigation through complex 3D terrain.
  - Comfort with depth (to 20+ m) and moderate current (if "tail" is dived on higher current days).
  - Relaxed breathing and air efficiency (deeper bottom time on moderate depth).
  - Awareness of entanglement risk in cavern environments (avoid unnecessary contact with corals and rock).

- **Challenges:**
  - Navigation complexity: Rock formations are intricate; easy to become disoriented without a guide.
  - Depth: Site regularly exceeds 16 m, demanding competent depth management and mental calculation.
  - Current variation: Unpredictable eddies or splits between "head" and "tail" can surprise divers used to simple current patterns.
  - Visibility reduction in low season: Navigating caverns in 8–10 m visibility is more challenging.
  - Entanglement: Tightly-spaced boulders and crevices increase contact risk; careless finning or buoyancy control can snag equipment on corals or rock.

- **Beginner notes:** Labas is NOT typically recommended for Open Water or newly-certified divers. The depth, structural complexity, and navigational demands exceed beginner comfort zones. Beginners should gain experience at shallow, simpler sites (e.g., Renggis Island) first.
- **OWD note:** Open Water divers may only dive this site in calm conditions, on shallow sections, and under direct guide supervision. Advanced Open Water is strongly recommended.

- **Advanced notes:** The site rewards advanced divers with excellent exploration opportunities, depth variance for skill practice (e.g., hovering at precise depths), and macro subjects. Advanced Diver certification holders or experienced recreational divers (50+ dives) will find appropriate challenge and interest.

## 8. Recommended Diver Profile

- **Certification:** Advanced Open Water (AOW) or equivalent

- **Min dive count:** 20–50+ dives preferred; recreational divers with solid buoyancy and navigation experience at similar-difficulty sites (e.g., Tiger Reef, Chebeh) are suitable. Fewer than 20 total dives generally not advisable.

- **Comfort level:**
  - Comfortable descending to 20+ m and managing air consumption at depth.
  - Confident navigating complex 3D reef structures and following guide instruction through caverns.
  - Able to maintain neutral buoyancy in current and around delicate coral.
  - Relaxed demeanor in relatively confined rock environments (no claustrophobia).
  - Experience with mild-to-moderate current (if diving the "head" on a strong-current day).

***

## 9. Hazards & Safety Notes

- **Physical hazards:**
  - **Entanglement risk:** Tight crevices and delicate corals in swim-throughs pose snag hazard for equipment (hoses, gauges, fins). Avoid unnecessary finning or contact. Follow guide instruction closely.
  - **Disorientation:** Complex rock formation can confuse navigation if separated from guide or distracted. Stay close to guide and maintain visual reference.
  - **Current-driven challenges:** Unexpected eddies or splits between zones can create disorienting current changes. Respect guide signals and abort if uncomfortable.

- **Depth risks:**
  - Site regularly reaches 20+ m; nitrogen narcosis symptoms may emerge in susceptible divers (increased depth beyond training).
  - Depth requires conservative air management; monitor NDL and remaining bottom time carefully.

- **Surface risks:**
  - Boat traffic in area is light but possible; ascent should be controlled and conducted on agreed line or feature.
  - Weather can change; rough surface conditions may prevent exit or require extended surface interval for boat positioning.

- **Environmental risks:**
  - Surge in cavern areas (if swell is significant) can move divers unexpectedly; avoid cavern entries in heavy swell.
  - Visibility reduction in low season (8–10 m) increases navigation and orientation difficulty.

- **Other hazards:**
  - **Stonefish and scorpionfish:** Well-camouflaged on rocks; avoid touching or stepping. Observe from distance.
  - **Lionfish:** Present in crevices; avoid hands-on observation and maintain distance during photography.
  - **Fire coral:** Present on some formations; contact causes irritation. Do not brush against it.
  - **Sea urchins:** Present in crevices and rubble; avoid contact.

- **Incidents:** No specific well-documented incidents reported in readily available sources. Site is considered safe when dived within recommended certification levels and with experienced guide.

## 10. Photography Notes

- **Lens recommendation:** Mixed macro and wide-angle. Labas's rock formations provide good wide-angle subjects, and the abundance of critters (nudibranch, scorpionfish, lionfish) rewards macro work.

- **Focal length:**
  - 60 mm macro lens ideal for small subjects (nudibranchs, crustaceans, pipefish, shrimps, octopus).
  - 16–35 mm wide-angle or fisheye effective for framing boulders and swim-through compositions.

- **Lighting:**
  - Strobes recommended for macro (to eliminate shadows and bring out colours in crevices).
  - Backscatter risk moderate; clear water in high season reduces backscatter, but cavern environments (darker shadows) benefit from fill flash.
  - Ambient light challenging in deeper caverns; lights or strobes essential for revealing colours.

- **Subject tips:**
  - Nudibranchs: Search rubble and rock crevices; small subjects requiring macro and patience.
  - Lionfish: Use wide-angle or mid-range macro; approach slowly from side or behind to avoid spooking.
  - Scorpionfish: Well-camouflaged; examine rocks closely; macro lens useful for detail shots.
  - Rock formations: Use wide-angle from distance to frame large boulders and swim-throughs; divers for scale.
  - Sharks and turtles: Both shy; wide-angle from distance if encountered; do not pursue.
  - Macro critters (shrimps, cuttlefish, octopus): Search at beginning or end of dive when visibility is calm; patience required.

- **Best time:** March–June (high season) offers best visibility and light penetration. Early morning dives (shortly after descent) often yield best visibility and lighting conditions.

- **Challenges:**
  - Low visibility in low season (July–October, early February) complicates wide-angle compositions and small-subject location.
  - Cavern environments create shadow zones; strobes essential for adequate lighting.
  - Strong current can reduce bottom time available for composed shots; plan subjects and positioning in advance.
  - Tight spaces around rocks limit distance for wide-angle framing; short focal lengths required.

## 12. Practical Tips

- **Timing:** No strong preference stated in sources for specific time of day (early vs. mid-morning). Current and sea state (tide-dependent) are primary scheduling factors; guide will choose "head" or "tail" based on conditions.

- **Frequency:** Labas is regularly included in Tioman operator dive schedules, especially on liveaboards and multi-site packages. Availability consistent during diving season (February–November).

- **Cancellations:** Labas may be swapped for alternative sites if current is unexpectedly strong or visibility poor on the day. Monsoon closure (November–January) is absolute; alternative islands (Aur, etc.) sometimes offered in transition months.

- **Gas choice:**
  - Air is standard and sufficient for the depth and profile. No special advantage to nitrox stated in sources.
  - Conservative gas planning recommended due to depth (to 24 m) and moderate current; consider dive computer or conservative tables.

- **Exposure protection:**
  - 3–5 mm wetsuit typical for tropical diving at Tioman (27–29 °C water).
  - 5 mm preferred if diving multiple days in a row to retain body heat and reduce fatigue.
  - No source-specific guidance for Labas; standard tropical practice applies.
