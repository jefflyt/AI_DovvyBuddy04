## 2. Site Overview

Renggis Island is a small, uninhabited island approximately 1 km offshore from the Berjaya Resort on Tioman Island. It is one of the most accessible and forgiving dive sites in the region, known for welcoming divers of all experience levels, from open-water graduates to advanced divers seeking a relaxed dive with rich marine life. The site has earned a reputation as a confidence-builder and a place where divers log personal "firsts"—their first shark, first turtle, first eel sighting.

- **Known for:** Abundant and approachable marine life (eels, nudibranchs, sea turtles, blacktip reef sharks); healthy staghorn and soft coral gardens; excellent teaching environment; fun underwater features (bicycle, jungle gym, treadmill).
- **Atmosphere:** Relaxed, exploratory, and non-threatening. The shallow depths and gentle current create a low-stress environment with plenty of time and air to observe behaviour and photography opportunities.
- **Why dive here:** It offers a perfect balance of accessibility and visual interest. New divers gain confidence in shallow, clear water with ample structure to explore; experienced divers enjoy spotting macro subjects and marine behaviour; instructors use it regularly for training and advanced skills practice.

## 3. Underwater Topography

- **Reef type:** Mixed (hard coral-dominated reef with soft coral patches; sand flats; rubble zones).
- **Depth contour:** Shallow slope from 4 m near the surface to 14–16 m at the deepest accessible areas. No sudden drop-offs.
- **Specific features:**
  - Staghorn coral formations (primary structure) hosting eels and nudibranchs in crevices.
  - Sand flats on the eastern side (often the entry point), providing calm landing and a stable teaching platform.
  - Soft coral patches scattered throughout, inhabited by reef fish, angelfishes, and occasional cleaning stations.
  - Playful artificial structures: a submerged bicycle, jungle gym, and treadmill (added for site enrichment and diver interest).
  - Small rocky outcrops and coral bommies providing shelter for macro life.
  - **Nearby Wrecks (Optional):** Two Thai fishing wrecks lie nearby at approximately 20 m depth; these are separate from the main reef and optional for advanced divers.
- **Key structures:** The island is surrounded by reef; the deepest useful depth (12–14 m) occurs on the western and southern flanks. The sand-to-reef transition on the eastern side is the standard entry/exit zone.

***

## 4. Typical Dive Profile

- **Entry method:** Giant stride from boat, or negative entry (weighted descent) into shallow sand (4–5 m).
- **Route:** Typically begin on the sandy eastern flat, orient, then move west or south along the reef perimeter at 10–14 m depth. Alternatively, conduct a circumnavigation at varying depths. Return to shallower water (6–10 m) for the safety stop.
- **Typical depth range:** 8–14 m (main bottom time); shallow enough for extended bottom time even on shallow air supplies.
- **Max recommended depth:** 16 m (stay shallower for recreational safety and to maximize air endurance).
- **Style:** Stationary reef exploration or gentle drift (depending on current direction and guide preference); often looped or circumnavigational.
- **Duration:** 40–50 minutes typical; easily extended to 60 minutes on shallow air.
- **Turnaround:** Shallow water (5–7 m) at the end of bottom time; ascend to safety stop in the 3–5 m band near the reef or sand.

## 5. Marine Life

- **Common species:**
  - Sea turtles (Green and Hawksbill; both species are frequently sighted resting or grazing).
  - Blacktip reef sharks (juvenile and adult; patrolling sand flats; non-aggressive but wary).
  - Reef eels (moray, garden; hiding in staghorn crevices; often spotted by guides pointing out cracks).
  - Wrasses (including cleaning wrasses that may "clean" divers' faces or equipment).
  - Parrotfish, surgeonfish, damselfish (reef residents).
  - Angelfish (large specimens common in soft coral patches).
  - Nudibranchs (various species in cracks and on rubble; macro subject).
  - Batfish (in schools, especially further out).

- **Occasional species:**
  - Scorpionfish (cryptic; found on rubble and hard substrate).
  - Lionfish (rare; well-camouflaged; noted in dive reports).
  - Blue-spotted rays (crossing sand flats).
  - Groupers and other large reef residents (seasonal, tide-dependent).

- **Rare encounters:**
  - Stonefish (documented but cryptic; only spotted if actively looked for).
  - Whale shark (mentioned in general Tioman reports; no specific Renggis sightings recorded in sources).

- **Seasonal highlights:**
  - March–May and September–November: Best overall marine life visibility and behaviour; water clarity favours spotting and photography.
  - June–August (low season): Water clarity reduced due to monsoonal runoff; marine life present but harder to spot; still productive for macro.

## 6. Conditions

- **Visibility:** 10–30 m depending on season and proximity to river runoff.
  - High season (March–May, September–November): 15–30 m typical; occasionally extending beyond 30 m on perfect days.
  - Low season (June–August): 8–12 m typical; sediment from monsoonal rains and island runoff reduces clarity.
  - Renggis is relatively sheltered and generally clearer than mainland Tioman reefs; offshore position helps.

- **Current:**
  - Generally mild to gentle.
  - Direction varies with tide: typically South-West on incoming tide, North-East on outgoing tide (or vice versa depending on local patterns).
  - Currents are rarely strong enough to prevent comfortable diving or detain divers.
  - Occasional eddies or subtle split currents near the island's edges, but nothing problematic for trained divers.

- **Surge/Swell:**
  - Mild to moderate depending on weather. The island provides some shelter from open ocean swell.
  - During calm conditions (common in dry season), surge is negligible.
  - Choppy surface conditions possible during monsoon transition but do not typically prevent diving.

- **Temperature:**
  - 27–29 °C year-round (tropical), with negligible seasonal variation.
  - Thermal exposure suit (3 mm) sufficient for comfort; 5 mm recommended for longer dives or cold-sensitive divers.

- **Triggers:**
  - Monsoonal activity (June–August) causes visibility drop due to river runoff and increased suspended sediment.
  - Tidal flow influences current direction but rarely makes the site undiveable.
  - Lunar cycles and seasonal upwelling do not severely impact local conditions.

## 7. Difficulty Assessment

- **Skills required:**
  - Neutral buoyancy and comfortable descent/ascent (essential at all depths).
  - Ability to navigate gently in current (typically not strong enough to challenge experienced open-water divers).
  - Basic awareness of surroundings and ability to follow guide (standard recreational competency).

- **Challenges:**
  - None significant. The site is deliberately designed as beginner-friendly.
  - Shallow depths can lead to rapid air consumption if breathing is elevated due to excitement; guides typically monitor air supply closely.
  - Macro subjects require calm, patient observation; some divers miss "firsts" by swimming too quickly.

- **Beginner notes:**
  - Perfect for confidence-building: shallow, clear, no strong currents, abundant life.
  - First-time shark and turtle encounters often occur here; guides manage expectations and distance.
  - Good practice for buoyancy control and coral awareness (stay off reef; respect corals).

- **Advanced notes:**
  - Limited technical depth, but excellent for practicing photography skills, naturalist observation, and teaching.
  - Ideal training site for instructors: controlled environment, reliable conditions, predictable marine life.
  - Experienced divers appreciate the richness of behaviour and macro subjects but do not consider it "challenging."

## 8. Recommended Diver Profile

- **Certification:** Open Water Diver (OWD) or equivalent; absolute minimum.
- **Min dive count:** 1–5 (site is often used for logged training dives and checkout dives).
- **Comfort level:**
  - No specific current-handling or depth experience required.
  - Comfortable entering water from a boat (standard giant stride or negative entry).
  - Relaxed attitude toward marine life and willingness to observe rather than chase subjects.
  - Macro-interested divers (photographers, naturalists) will extract maximum value.

***

## 9. Hazards & Safety Notes

- **Physical hazards:**
  - None significant. No downcurrents, unpredictable eddies, or severe surge documented.
  - Occasional mild current; not a hazard for trained divers but requires gentle finning and awareness.

- **Depth risks:**
  - Shallow depths (4–16 m) mean no decompression concerns or nitrogen narcosis risk. Dive profiles are inherently conservative.

- **Surface risks:**
  - Occasional boat traffic near the island (resort area); guides maintain awareness and surface divers in designated zones.
  - Boat pick-up is straightforward in calm conditions; inform boat crew of dive conclusion.

- **Environmental risks:**
  - Wave exposure is generally low except during monsoon season; divers in choppy conditions should brief carefully and ascend in controlled fashion.
  - No overhead environments (caves, overhangs) requiring special training.
  - Staghorn corals are fragile; careless finning or kneeling causes damage; guides brief on coral etiquette.

- **Other hazards:**
  - Eels in coral cracks: though non-aggressive, do not insert fingers or dive lights into holes.
  - Nudibranchs and other small creatures: observe only; some (e.g., certain sea stars) have irritating properties if touched.
  - Scorpionfish camouflage: rare but present; guides point them out to avoid accidental contact.

- **Incidents:**
  - No major incident history documented in provided sources.
  - The site's beginner-friendly reputation and consistent use by training operators suggest a strong safety record.

## 10. Photography Notes

- **Lens recommendation:** Mixed (both macro and wide-angle useful depending on subject and visibility).
- **Focal length:**
  - Macro (60 mm or 105 mm equivalent): For eels, nudibranchs, small reef fish, detail shots of corals and crustaceans.
  - Wide-angle (16–24 mm equivalent): For reef landscapes, turtle and shark encounter shots, whole-site context.

- **Lighting:**
  - Strobes recommended in low season (8–12 m visibility) to recover colour and contrast.
  - Ambient lighting sufficient in high season if shooting during daylight hours (typically 10:00–14:00 local time).
  - Backscatter risk minimal in clear conditions but present in low-season turbidity; shoot away from suspended particles.

- **Subject tips:**
  - Turtles are habituated; approach slowly and remain still for best shots. Allow them to move toward you rather than chasing.
  - Sharks are skittish; long lens and patience required. Shoot distance shots rather than close passes.
  - Eels in coral: use macro lens, light to illuminate crevices without disturbing the animal.
  - Reef fish schooling: shoot wide-angle against blue water backdrop.
  - Nudibranchs: macro, manual focus, strobes for detail.

- **Best time:**
  - High season (March–May, September–November) for optimal clarity, colour saturation, and longer shutter speeds.
  - Morning to midday (08:00–14:00) for best ambient light and angle.

- **Challenges:**
  - Low-season visibility (June–August) limits wide-angle work; macro remains viable.
  - Backscatter in turbid water; minimize strobes and shoot into open water where possible.
  - Skittish sharks; expect distant shots only.
  - Depth limitation (max 16 m) means no extreme blue-water backgrounds; composition relies on reef features and critter subjects.

## 11. Best Time to Dive

- **High season (March–May):**
  - Visibility: 15–30 m, often excellent.
  - Water temperature: 27–29 °C (no change year-round).
  - Weather: Dry; calm seas; predictable conditions.
  - Marine life: Active; peak behaviour periods.
  - Why: Best overall diving experience; photographers achieve peak results; most reliable conditions.

- **Shoulder season (September–November):**
  - Visibility: 15–30 m, similar to high season.
  - Weather: Transition period; occasional rough seas but generally good.
  - Marine life: Good activity levels.
  - Why: Fewer tourists than March–May; still excellent conditions; good balance of quality and availability.

- **Low season (June–August):**
  - Visibility: 8–12 m (reduced due to monsoonal rain, river runoff, suspended sediment).
  - Weather: Monsoon-influenced; potential for rough seas and choppy surfaces.
  - Diving: Still possible and rewarding; macro life abundant; fewer divers present.
  - Why: Lower cost; less crowded; good for macro and naturalist work; acceptable for training.

- **February and November (transition months):**
  - Variable conditions; generally diveable but less consistent.

- **Monthly specifics (inferred from sources):**
  - **March–May:** Optimal window; clearest visibility of the year.
  - **June–August:** Reduced visibility; diving still active but conditions variable.
  - **September–November:** Recovery to excellent; best of both worlds (clarity and fewer crowds).
  - **December–February:** Sporadic; some dive operators reduce frequency; occasional rough seas.

## 12. Practical Tips

- **Timing:**
  - Dive early (morning; 08:00–10:00) for calmest surface conditions and best ambient light.
  - Afternoon dives (13:00–15:00) also good but may encounter midday heat on surface.
  - Night dives possible; conducted with lights and guide briefing (eels, nocturnal cephalopods active).

- **Frequency:**
  - Renggis is commonly visited by resort-based operators (day trips) and liveaboard operations.
  - Often included as a second or third dive of the day (short boat transit from other nearby sites).
  - Heavily utilised as a training and check-out site; expect other training groups in high season.

- **Cancellations:**
  - Rare. Renggis is sheltered and forgiving; only extreme weather (typhoon conditions, monsoonal storms) causes cancellations.
  - Dry-season trips (February–November) are rarely cancelled.

- **Gas choice:**
  - Standard air suitable for all profiles (max depth 16 m, typically 12–14 m).
  - Nitrox not necessary but acceptable if diver holds certification; no specific advantage given shallow depths and short typical bottom times.
  - Air consumption monitoring important for guides (inexperienced divers may breathe heavily from excitement).

- **Exposure protection:**
  - 3 mm wetsuit sufficient for tropical comfort and coral protection.
  - 5 mm recommended for divers sensitive to cold or planning multiple consecutive days.
  - Rash guard alone acceptable in shallow water during high season.
