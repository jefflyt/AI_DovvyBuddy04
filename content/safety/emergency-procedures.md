# Emergency Procedures

## Out of Air Situations

### What to Do If You Run Out of Air

Running out of air underwater is a serious emergency, but staying calm and following proper procedures can save your life.

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Signal your buddy immediately** - Use the "out of air" signal (throat-cutting gesture)
2. **Ascend to your buddy** - Swim directly to your buddy if they're nearby
3. **Share air** - Use your buddy's alternate air source (octopus regulator)
4. **Begin controlled ascent** - Ascend together at a safe rate (18m/60ft per minute)
5. **Maintain contact** - Hold onto each other during the ascent

### Alternate Air Source (Octopus)

Your buddy's alternate air source is your primary safety backup:

- **Yellow regulator** - Usually bright yellow for easy identification
- **Location** - Typically secured in the triangle area (chin to lower rib cage)
- **Practice** - Regular practice during training builds muscle memory
- **Breathing** - Take slow, controlled breaths to conserve remaining air

### Emergency Swimming Ascent (ESA)

If your buddy is not nearby and you're at shallow depth (<9m/30ft):

1. **Look up** - Establish visual reference to surface
2. **Arm extended** - Keep one arm raised above your head
3. **Kick steadily** - Use strong, controlled kicks
4. **Exhale continuously** - Say "Ahhhh" to prevent lung overexpansion
5. **Rotate 360°** - Watch for obstacles and your buddy

**NEVER attempt ESA from deep depths** - Risk of decompression sickness and lung overexpansion injury is too high.

### Emergency Buoyant Ascent

As a last resort when completely out of air at depth:

1. **Drop weights** - Release weight belt or integrated weights
2. **Flare position** - Spread arms and legs to slow ascent
3. **Exhale continuously** - Essential to prevent lung injury
4. **Look up** - Watch for surface obstacles

**Warning**: This is extremely dangerous and should only be used when death is imminent.

## Buddy Separation

### Prevention

- **Maintain contact** - Stay within arm's reach in poor visibility
- **Frequent checks** - Look for your buddy every 30-60 seconds
- **Dive lights** - Use lights even in daylight to maintain visual contact
- **Briefing** - Establish hand signals and procedures before diving

### If Separated

**Standard procedure (taught in Open Water):**

1. **Stop immediately** - Don't chase or panic
2. **Look around** - Make one complete 360° rotation (1 minute)
3. **Ascend slowly** - Rise 3-5m and look around again
4. **Surface if not found** - Ascend to surface after 1 minute total search
5. **Meet at surface** - Reunite at last known location or boat

**In current:**
- Ascend immediately if in strong current
- Don't fight current to search
- Surface and reunite on boat/shore

## Equipment Malfunctions

### Regulator Free Flow

When your regulator continuously releases air:

1. **Don't panic** - You have air, just flowing freely
2. **Purge and breathe** - Press purge button, take controlled breaths from the side
3. **Signal buddy** - Let them know you have a problem
4. **Switch to octopus** - Use alternate air source
5. **End dive** - Controlled ascent to surface

**In cold water**: Free flow is common below 10°C (50°F). Keep regulator in mouth between breaths.

### BCD Inflator Stuck Open

Your BCD is inflating uncontrollably:

1. **Disconnect inflator hose** - Pull quick-disconnect at the BCD
2. **Vent BCD manually** - Use dump valves or raise hose
3. **Maintain depth** - Use fins to counteract positive buoyancy
4. **Signal buddy** - Communication is key
5. **Controlled ascent** - If you can't maintain depth, ascend safely

### Mask Flood or Loss

Complete mask flooding or loss underwater:

1. **Stay calm** - You can breathe without a mask
2. **Close eyes** - Protect from saltwater irritation
3. **Breathe through regulator** - Maintain normal breathing
4. **Hold regulator** - Keep it secure in your mouth
5. **Signal buddy** - Get assistance if needed
6. **Clear or ascend** - Either clear mask or make controlled ascent

**Tip**: Practice no-mask breathing in confined water during training.

## Medical Emergencies

### Signs of Decompression Sickness (DCS)

**Symptoms** (can appear minutes to hours after diving):
- Joint or muscle pain ("the bends")
- Tingling, numbness, or paralysis
- Dizziness or vertigo
- Difficulty breathing
- Extreme fatigue or weakness
- Skin rash or itching

**Immediate Response:**
1. **Call emergency services** - Dial emergency number immediately
2. **Administer 100% oxygen** - If available and trained
3. **Keep diver lying down** - On left side if unconscious
4. **Monitor breathing** - Be ready to perform CPR
5. **Contact DAN** - Divers Alert Network (emergency hotline)
6. **Hyperbaric chamber** - Emergency evacuation may be needed

**NEVER** ignore DCS symptoms - they will not resolve on their own.

### Lung Overexpansion Injuries

Caused by holding breath during ascent:

**Symptoms:**
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing
- Bloody cough or frothy sputum
- Hoarseness or voice changes
- Neck swelling
- Confusion or unconsciousness

**Response:**
- Same as DCS protocol above
- This is a life-threatening emergency
- Requires immediate medical attention

### Ear or Sinus Barotrauma

Pain during descent due to pressure imbalance:

**Prevention:**
- Never dive with congestion or cold
- Equalize early and often
- Descend feet-first and slowly
- Stop if you feel pain

**If Pain Occurs:**
1. **Stop descent immediately**
2. **Ascend 1-2m** to reduce pressure
3. **Attempt equalization** - Gentle Valsalva or other techniques
4. **Abort dive** if pain continues
5. **Seek medical attention** if pain persists after surfacing

## Lost at Sea Procedures

If you surface far from the boat:

1. **Establish positive buoyancy** - Inflate BCD fully
2. **Signal distress** - Wave arms, use whistle, deploy safety sausage
3. **Stay together** - Group with your buddy and other divers
4. **Conserve energy** - Don't swim against current
5. **Stay visible** - Deploy marker buoy, use dive light at night
6. **Remove weights** - If needed to maintain buoyancy (last resort)

**Prevention:**
- Always dive with surface marker buoy (SMB)
- Carry whistle and dive light
- Know how to deploy SMB from depth
- Dive with experienced boat operators

## Panic Management

Panic is the leading cause of diving accidents:

**Signs of Panic:**
- Rapid, shallow breathing
- Wide eyes, frantic movements
- Dropping equipment
- Bolt to surface

**Self-Management:**
1. **Stop all movement** - Freeze and break the panic cycle
2. **Breathe slowly** - Force yourself to take slow, deep breaths
3. **Think** - Remind yourself you have air and time
4. **Act** - Make one small positive action (check gauge, signal buddy)

**Helping Panicked Diver:**
1. **Establish eye contact** - Get their attention
2. **Signal "OK?"** - Try to communicate
3. **Signal "Stop"** - Get them to pause
4. **Control ascent** - If ascending, ensure safe rate
5. **Maintain contact** - Physical touch can be calming
