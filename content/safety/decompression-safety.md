# Decompression Safety

## Understanding Decompression

Decompression is the process of safely releasing nitrogen absorbed by your body during a dive. Proper decompression management is **critical** to prevent decompression sickness (DCS), also known as "the bends."

### What Happens During a Dive

**Nitrogen Absorption:**

1. At depth, you breathe compressed air (79% nitrogen)
2. Higher pressure forces nitrogen into your bloodstream
3. Nitrogen dissolves into body tissues over time
4. Deeper and longer dives = more nitrogen absorption

**During Ascent:**

1. Pressure decreases as you ascend
2. Nitrogen comes out of solution (like opening a soda bottle)
3. If ascent is too fast, nitrogen forms bubbles in tissues/blood
4. These bubbles cause decompression sickness

**Key Principle:** Ascend slowly enough for nitrogen to exit safely through your lungs, not form bubbles in your body.

## No-Decompression Limits (NDL)

No-decompression diving means you can ascend directly to the surface (with safety stop) without mandatory decompression stops.

### Standard Recreational NDLs (PADI RDP Example)

| Depth       | NDL Time | Pressure Groups    |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| 12m (40ft)  | 140+ min | Very safe          |
| 18m (60ft)  | 56 min   | Typical reef depth |
| 24m (80ft)  | 29 min   | Deeper wrecks      |
| 30m (100ft) | 20 min   | Recreational limit |
| 40m (130ft) | 9 min    | Advanced only      |

**Important Notes:**

- These are MAXIMUM limits, not targets
- Conservative diving adds safety margin
- Computer algorithms vary (always follow your computer)
- Altitude, cold water, and other factors reduce NDLs

### Dive Computer Essentials

**What your computer tracks:**

- Current depth and time
- Nitrogen loading in tissue compartments
- Remaining no-decompression time
- Ascent rate (too fast warnings)
- Safety stop recommendations
- Surface interval tracking

**Critical Computer Skills:**

1. **Monitor NDL constantly** - Check every few minutes
2. **Plan turnaround time** - Leave with plenty of NDL remaining
3. **Heed warnings** - If it beeps or flashes, respond immediately
4. **Conservative settings** - Use if diving multiple days or at altitude
5. **Battery maintenance** - Replace before dive trips

## Safe Ascent Procedures

### Ascent Rate: 18m/60ft Per Minute

**This is MAXIMUM, not target:**

- Slower is always better (9-12m/min is ideal)
- Watch your computer's ascent rate indicator
- If warning sounds, SLOW DOWN immediately
- Use your dive computer or watch and depth gauge

**Visual Reference:**

- Your smallest exhaled bubbles rise at ~18m/min
- Stay slower than or equal to your bubbles
- Use a guideline/anchor line when possible

**Why slow ascents matter:**

- Gives nitrogen time to diffuse safely
- Reduces bubble formation
- Allows body to compensate gradually
- First line of defense against DCS

### The Safety Stop: 5m for 3 Minutes

**Standard procedure:**

- Stop at 5m (15ft) depth
- Remain for 3 minutes minimum
- Maintain neutral buoyancy
- Monitor computer and remaining air

**Why it's critical:**

- Allows additional nitrogen off-gassing
- Reduces DCS risk by ~50%
- Provides buffer for depth gauge errors
- Time to check for boat traffic above

**When it's MANDATORY:**

- All dives deeper than 18m (60ft)
- Any dive approaching NDL limits
- Repetitive dives
- Multi-day diving
- If computer or instructor requires it

**Extended safety stops:**

- 5 minutes at 5m after deep dives (30m+)
- 8 minutes after aggressive profiles
- Per computer recommendation

### Deep Stops (Controversial)

**What they are:**

- Brief stops during ascent from deep dives
- Example: 1 minute at half your max depth
- Theory: Reduces bubble formation

**Current Consensus:**

- Not universally recommended anymore
- May increase overall nitrogen load
- Follow YOUR computer's algorithm
- If computer doesn't require it, optional

## Repetitive Diving

Multiple dives in one day require extra caution:

### Surface Intervals

**Purpose:**

- Allow nitrogen to off-gas between dives
- Body slowly returns to equilibrium
- Longer intervals = safer second dive

**Minimum surface intervals:**

- 1 hour minimum between dives
- 2+ hours is better
- Follow dive computer's recommendations
- Never "round down" on surface interval

**Surface Interval Activities:**

- Rest in shade (avoid overheating)
- Hydrate well (water, not alcohol)
- Light snack (avoid heavy meals)
- Review dive plan for next dive
- Don't exercise heavily

### Planning Repetitive Dives

**Golden Rule: Deepest Dive First**

**Correct profile:**

1. **Dive 1:** 25m (82ft) - wreck dive
2. **Surface interval:** 90 minutes
3. **Dive 2:** 15m (49ft) - reef dive

**Wrong profile (reverse):**

1. **Dive 1:** 15m - shallow reef
2. **Dive 2:** 25m - deeper wreck
3. Result: Higher DCS risk due to pressure increase

**Why deepest-first is safer:**

- Second dive is shallower (lower pressure)
- Reduces nitrogen loading on second dive
- Allows continued off-gassing during shallow dive

### Multiple Days of Diving

**Considerations:**

- Residual nitrogen accumulates over days
- Risk increases with each day
- More conservative on day 3-7 than day 1

**Best practices:**

- Take a day off after 5-6 consecutive dive days
- Use computer's conservative/repetitive settings
- Limit number of dives per day (3-4 maximum)
- Ensure full 12+ hours surface interval overnight
- Consider nitrox for multi-day diving

## Decompression Sickness (DCS)

### Types of DCS

**Type I (Musculoskeletal):**

- Joint pain ("the bends") - elbows, shoulders, knees
- Skin rash, itching
- Fatigue, malaise
- Generally less severe but still requires treatment

**Type II (Serious):**

- Neurological symptoms (weakness, numbness, paralysis)
- Inner ear (vertigo, nausea, hearing loss)
- Pulmonary (chest pain, difficulty breathing)
- Cardiac symptoms
- Life-threatening - immediate treatment required

### DCS Symptoms

**Common signs (can appear anytime 1-24 hours after diving):**

- Unusual fatigue (beyond normal post-dive tiredness)
- Joint pain, especially in large joints
- Skin rash, marbling, or itching
- Numbness or tingling
- Difficulty urinating
- Dizziness or vertigo
- Difficulty breathing or chest tightness
- Confusion or personality changes
- Weakness in limbs
- Loss of coordination

**RED FLAGS (immediate emergency):**

- Paralysis
- Loss of consciousness
- Severe chest pain
- Inability to breathe normally
- Seizures

### DCS Risk Factors

**Dive-related:**

- Exceeding NDLs
- Fast ascents
- Skipping safety stops
- Repetitive deep dives
- Saw-tooth profiles (up and down)
- Cold water exposure
- Strenuous diving

**Personal factors:**

- Dehydration (major risk factor)
- Fatigue or lack of sleep
- Obesity (nitrogen dissolves in fat)
- Older age (slower circulation)
- Previous DCS history
- Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) - heart defect
- Alcohol consumption before/after diving
- Flying after diving

### DCS Prevention

**Conservative diving practices:**

1. **Stay well within NDLs**
   - End dive with 10+ minutes NDL remaining
   - Don't push limits

2. **Proper ascent rate**
   - Maximum 18m/60ft per minute
   - Slower is better (9-12m/min ideal)

3. **Always do safety stops**
   - 3-5 minutes at 5m (15ft)
   - Even on shallow dives

4. **Optimal dive profiles**
   - Deepest dive first
   - Adequate surface intervals
   - Avoid yo-yo diving (up and down)

5. **Hydration**
   - Drink water before, between, and after dives
   - Urine should be clear/light colored
   - Avoid alcohol and caffeine

6. **Physical condition**
   - Be well-rested
   - Don't dive if ill
   - Maintain fitness
   - Avoid heavy exercise before/after

7. **Conservative computer settings**
   - Use when diving multiple days
   - Consider +1 or +2 conservatism setting
   - Some computers have "repetitive dive" modes

8. **Post-dive precautions**
   - No flying for 12-24 hours after diving
   - Avoid hot tubs/saunas
   - Don't exercise heavily
   - Stay hydrated

### DCS Treatment: Immediate Response

**If you suspect DCS in yourself or buddy:**

1. **Stop all activity immediately**
2. **Call emergency services**
   - DAN Emergency Hotline: +1-919-684-9111
   - Local emergency: 911 (USA), 112 (EU), etc.

3. **Administer 100% oxygen**
   - If available and you're trained
   - Use non-rebreather mask
   - Highest flow rate possible

4. **Position patient**
   - Lying down, on left side if unconscious
   - Do NOT place head-down (old myth)

5. **Keep patient calm and warm**
   - Reassure them
   - Light blanket if cold
   - No food or drink if serious symptoms

6. **Monitor vitals**
   - Breathing, pulse, consciousness
   - Be ready to perform CPR if needed

7. **Arrange hyperbaric chamber transport**
   - DAN will coordinate
   - May require helicopter evacuation
   - Do NOT attempt to dive again (will make it worse)

8. **Document everything**
   - Dive profiles
   - Symptoms and timeline
   - Treatment given
   - This info helps medical staff

**Critical:** Even if symptoms improve, STILL seek medical evaluation. Symptoms can return or worsen.

## Nitrox and Decompression

### Benefits of Enriched Air (Nitrox)

**What it is:**

- Air with higher oxygen % (typically 32% or 36%)
- Lower nitrogen % than regular air (79% nitrogen)

**Advantages:**

- Reduced nitrogen loading at same depth
- Longer no-decompression limits
- Shorter required surface intervals
- Reduced post-dive fatigue (anecdotal)
- Safer for repetitive/multi-day diving

**Example NDL comparison (32% nitrox):**

- 18m (60ft): 95 min vs 56 min on air
- 24m (80ft): 45 min vs 29 min on air

### Nitrox Precautions

**Oxygen toxicity limits:**

- Maximum depth based on oxygen %
- EAN32: 40m (130ft) maximum
- EAN36: 34m (110ft) maximum
- Exceeding = risk of convulsions underwater

**Required:**

- Nitrox certification before use
- Analyze tank contents before EVERY dive
- Set computer to correct nitrox mix
- Label tank clearly

**Not a substitute for:**

- Proper ascent procedures
- Safety stops
- Conservative diving
- Computer monitoring

## Special Decompression Considerations

### Altitude Diving

**Why it's different:**

- Lower atmospheric pressure at altitude
- Body saturated with nitrogen at higher "sea level"
- Computer must be set to altitude mode
- NDLs significantly reduced

**Adjustments needed:**

- Special tables or altitude-capable computer
- More conservative profiles
- Longer surface intervals
- Acclimatization period before diving

### Cold Water Diving

**Effects on decompression:**

- Reduces circulation (slows off-gassing)
- Increases work of breathing
- Higher gas consumption
- Many computers adjust automatically

**Recommendations:**

- Add conservatism to computer
- Shorter NDLs than warm water equivalent
- Longer safety stops
- Proper thermal protection essential

### Flying After Diving

**Absolute Rules:**

**After single no-decompression dive:**

- Wait minimum 12 hours before flying
- 18 hours is more conservative

**After multiple dives or multiple days:**

- Wait minimum 18 hours
- 24 hours is recommended
- Some agencies say 24-48 hours

**After decompression diving:**

- Wait minimum 24-48 hours
- Consult with dive computer manual

**Why this matters:**

- Cabin pressure = ~2,400m (8,000ft) altitude
- Reduced pressure can cause DCS even after safe dive
- Symptoms can appear during flight
- Medical help limited at 30,000 feet

**Applies to:**

- Commercial flights
- Private aircraft
- Skydiving
- Hot air balloons
- Driving to high altitude (mountain passes)

## Key Takeaways

✅ **DO:**

- Stay well within no-decompression limits
- Ascend slowly (max 18m/min, slower is better)
- Always perform 3-5 minute safety stop at 5m
- Plan deepest dive first when doing multiples
- Stay hydrated before, during, and after diving
- Use conservative computer settings
- Wait 12-24 hours before flying

❌ **DON'T:**

- Exceed NDLs (even by 1 minute)
- Skip safety stops (EVER)
- Ascend faster than 18m/min
- Dive immediately after drinking alcohol
- Exercise heavily after diving
- Fly within 12 hours of diving
- Ignore DCS symptoms ("hoping they'll go away")

**Remember:** Decompression sickness is preventable through conservative diving practices. When in doubt, dive more conservatively. The most important rule: Better to waste a dive than waste a diver.
