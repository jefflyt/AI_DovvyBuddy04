# OW_Limits_Progression_and_Safety
**PADI Open Water Diver Certification**

## Depth and Training Limits
The Open Water Diver certification qualifies divers to dive within defined training limits.

### Maximum Depth Limits
- **Adults (15+)**: 18 meters / 60 feet
- **Junior Open Water Diver (ages 12–14)**: 18 meters / 60 feet with a certified adult
- **Junior Open Water Diver (ages 10–11)**: 12 meters / 40 feet with a PADI Professional or certified parent/guardian

Diving beyond these limits requires additional training.

## Supervision and Experience Considerations
Although Open Water Divers are certified for independent buddy diving, newly certified divers are encouraged to:
- Dive with more experienced buddies
- Participate in guided or group dives when building experience
- Gradually gain confidence through repeated practice

Experience is developed through continued diving, not certification alone.

---

## Medical and Fitness Considerations
Scuba diving places physical demands on the body. Certain medical conditions may affect diving safety.

Divers are required to:
- Complete a medical questionnaire during training
- Seek physician clearance when indicated
- Consider personal fitness, health, and comfort before diving

---

## Environmental Responsibility
Open Water Diver training emphasizes respect for the aquatic environment.

Divers are expected to:
- Avoid contact with coral and marine life
- Maintain proper buoyancy control
- Follow local environmental regulations and marine park rules

Environmental awareness is an essential part of recreational diving.

---

## Refresher and Review Expectations
While the Open Water Diver certification does not expire, divers who have not dived for an extended period (typically 6–12 months) may be required by dive operators to complete a refresher or scuba review before diving.

This practice is common and intended to promote safety and comfort.

---

## Progression to Further Training
After Open Water Diver certification, divers may continue their education through:
- **Advanced Open Water Diver** training, which expands depth limits and experience
- Specialty courses such as buoyancy control, navigation, or enriched air diving
- **Rescue Diver** training, focused on dive safety and emergency response

Continuing education allows divers to expand skills, confidence, and diving opportunities.

---

## Summary
The Open Water Diver certification establishes defined depth limits, foundational safety awareness, and a pathway for continued development. Safe diving depends on staying within training limits, maintaining health and fitness, respecting the environment, and building experience through ongoing practice and education.
