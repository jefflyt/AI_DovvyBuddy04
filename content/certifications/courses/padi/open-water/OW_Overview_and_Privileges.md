# OW_Overview_and_Privileges
**PADI Open Water Diver Certification**

## Certification Overview
The PADI Open Water Diver course is a globally recognized, entry-level scuba certification for recreational diving. Successfully completing the course allows divers to dive independently with a buddy to a maximum depth of 18 meters (60 feet).

This certification is the standard entry point into recreational scuba diving and is accepted worldwide.

## Who This Certification Is For
The Open Water Diver certification is designed for individuals with no prior scuba diving experience, new divers seeking a recognized recreational scuba qualification, and divers who wish to continue with advanced or specialty training.

No previous diving experience is required to enroll.

## Certification Status and Validity
The Open Water Diver certification is lifetime valid and does not require renewal. It is globally recognized by dive operators and resorts and aligns with World Recreational Scuba Training Council (WRSTC) standards.

Divers who have not dived for an extended period may be required by some operators to complete a refresher or review.

## Diving Privileges After Certification
After certification, an Open Water Diver may dive with another certified diver, conduct recreational dives within training limits, rent or use scuba equipment through dive operators, participate in recreational dives worldwide, and enroll in continuing education and specialty courses.

## Maximum Depth Limits
Certified Open Water Divers are trained to the following maximum depths:
- Adults (15+): 18 meters / 60 feet
- Junior Open Water Diver (ages 12–14): 18 meters / 60 feet with a certified adult
- Junior Open Water Diver (ages 10–11): 12 meters / 40 feet with a PADI Professional or certified parent/guardian

Diving beyond these limits requires additional training.

## Junior Open Water Diver Restrictions
Junior Open Water Diver certifications apply to divers aged 10–14 and include age-based depth limits, supervision requirements based on age, and automatic upgrade to full Open Water Diver certification at age 15.

## Independence and Buddy Requirements
Open Water Diver certification allows independent recreational diving with a certified buddy and use of the buddy system as a core safety practice. Solo diving is not included in this certification.

## Recognition and Transferability
The Open Water Diver certification is accepted by dive operators worldwide, recognized across agencies aligned with WRSTC standards, and valid as a prerequisite for continuing education and specialty training.

## Common Clarifications
The certification allows recreational diving within defined training limits. Depth limits apply regardless of location. Additional training is required for deeper diving or specialized environments.

## Summary
The PADI Open Water Diver certification is the standard entry-level qualification for recreational scuba diving. It allows certified divers to dive with a buddy to 18 meters (60 feet), is lifetime valid, globally recognized, and forms the foundation for all further recreational scuba training.
