# EFR Validity Renewal and Equivalency
**Emergency First Response (EFR)**

## Certification Validity
Emergency First Response certifications are **valid for 24 months** from the date of completion.

This validity period applies to:
- Primary Care (CPR)
- Secondary Care (First Aid)
- Combined Primary and Secondary Care
- Care for Children
- CPR and AED
- Emergency Oxygen Provider

---

## Renewal Requirements
To maintain a current EFR certification, participants must:
- Complete an **EFR Refresher** course, or
- Retake the full EFR course

Renewal ensures skills and knowledge remain aligned with current emergency care guidelines.

---

## Refresher vs Full Course
- **EFR Refresher**: Intended for participants with a valid or recently expired certification
- **Full Course**: Required if certification has been expired for an extended period or when mandated by training providers

The choice between refresher and full course is determined by instructor or training center policy.

---

## Equivalency With Other Emergency Care Certifications
EFR certifications are commonly accepted as equivalent to other internationally recognized CPR and first aid training programs.

Examples of accepted equivalents may include:
- American Red Cross
- American Heart Association (AHA)
- St John Ambulance
- Other nationally recognized CPR and first aid providers

Acceptance of equivalent certifications is subject to:
- Course content coverage
- Certification validity (typically within 24 months)
- Instructor or training organization requirements

---

## Role in PADI Training Prerequisites
A current EFR certification (or accepted equivalent) is a prerequisite for several PADI courses, including:
- Rescue Diver
- Divemaster
- Instructor-level certifications

Both **Primary Care and Secondary Care** are typically required to meet these prerequisites.

---

## Verification and Acceptance
Dive centers and instructors may verify emergency care certifications during enrollment for advanced training. Participants are responsible for ensuring their certification is current at the time of training.

---

## Summary
EFR certifications are valid for 24 months and must be renewed to remain current. Refresher and full course options are available, and equivalent CPR and first aid certifications are commonly accepted when they meet validity and content requirements. Maintaining a current emergency care certification is essential for progression within the PADI training system.
