# Emergency First Response (EFR) Certification by PADI

Emergency First Response (EFR) is an international CPR, AED, and First Aid training organization and PADI affiliate specializing in teaching lifesaving emergency response skills to both divers and non-divers. EFR training provides the knowledge and confidence to respond effectively in medical emergencies, whether in diving situations or everyday life.

## EFR and PADI Dive Training Integration

### Prerequisites for PADI Courses

| PADI Course | EFR Requirement |
|---|---|
| Open Water Diver | None |
| Advanced Open Water Diver | None |
| **Rescue Diver** | **EFR Primary and Secondary Care (or equivalent) within 24 months** |
| **Divemaster** | **EFR Primary and Secondary Care (or equivalent) within 24 months** |
| **Assistant Instructor** | **EFR Instructor certification** |
| **Instructor (IDC)** | **EFR Instructor certification (completed during or before IE)** |

**Note**: "Equivalent" means CPR and First Aid from Red Cross, AHA, St. John Ambulance, or other recognized agencies—must be within 24 months.

### EFR + Rescue Diver Package

Many dive centers offer combined EFR + Rescue Diver courses:

**Typical Schedule**:
- **Day 1**: EFR Primary and Secondary Care (8-9 hours)
- **Days 2-4**: PADI Rescue Diver (knowledge development, scenarios, open water rescue dives)

**Benefits**:
- Efficient scheduling (complete both in 3-4 days)
- Skills from EFR directly applied in Rescue scenarios
- Package pricing (often discounted vs. separate courses)
- Single instructor continuity

**Cost**: Combined package typically USD $400-$700 depending on location.

---

## Safety Considerations

### Medical Fitness to Participate

**Physical Requirements**:
- Ability to perform chest compressions (requires physical strength and stamina)
- Ability to kneel and perform skills on floor
- No medical conditions preventing CPR performance (e.g., severe back/knee injuries, heart/lung conditions)

**Medical Questionnaire**: Participants complete medical form; positive responses may require physician clearance.

**Opting Out of Skills**: Participants unable to perform CPR for medical reasons may observe and learn but will not receive certification (receive Certificate of Attendance instead).

### Legal and Ethical Considerations

**Good Samaritan Laws**:
- Most jurisdictions protect layperson rescuers providing emergency care in good faith
- EFR training teaches within scope of layperson practice
- Participants learn to recognize limits of their training

**Duty to Act**:
- Laypersons generally have no legal duty to provide care (unless employment requires it)
- Once care is started, rescuer should continue until:
  - EMS arrives and takes over
  - Scene becomes unsafe
  - Rescuer is physically unable to continue
  - Patient recovers or care is refused

**Consent**:
- Conscious adults must consent to care
- Unconscious individuals: implied consent (assumed they would want life-saving help)
- Children: parent/guardian consent when available; implied consent in emergencies

**Psychological Considerations**:
- Providing emergency care can be stressful
- EFR training prepares participants emotionally through realistic scenarios
- Post-incident stress is normal; debriefing and professional support recommended

### Disease Transmission Prevention

EFR emphasizes **Universal Precautions**:
- Use barrier devices (CPR masks, gloves) whenever possible
- Avoid contact with bodily fluids
- Proper hand hygiene after providing care
- Bloodborne pathogen awareness

**Barriers Taught in EFR**:
- Pocket masks with one-way valves for rescue breathing
- Face shields
- Protective gloves
- Proper disposal of contaminated materials
