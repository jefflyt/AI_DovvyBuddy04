# EFR Diving Integration and Emergency Oxygen
**Emergency First Response (EFR)**

## Role of EFR in Diving
Emergency First Response training plays a key role in diver safety by preparing individuals to respond to medical emergencies until professional care is available. While EFR is not a scuba certification, it is integrated into the PADI training system as a prerequisite for advanced and professional-level diver education.

EFR emphasizes calm, structured response and situational awareness, which align with the demands of managing diving-related incidents.

---

## Relationship to Rescue Diver Training
EFR training supports the objectives of Rescue Diver education by providing foundational emergency care knowledge.

Within the PADI system:
- A current EFR certification (or accepted equivalent) is required before enrolling in Rescue Diver training
- EFR focuses on emergency care skills, while Rescue Diver training focuses on diver rescue scenarios and accident management

These components are complementary and serve different purposes.

---

## Emergency Oxygen Provider Overview
Emergency oxygen is widely recognized as a critical first response tool in diving-related incidents. The EFR Emergency Oxygen Provider course introduces the role of oxygen in emergency response and accident management.

### Scope
- Overview of emergency oxygen use in diving contexts
- Familiarization with common oxygen delivery systems
- Understanding when emergency oxygen may be appropriate as part of first response

The Emergency Oxygen Provider course does not replace formal medical training or professional medical care.

---

## Use by Divers and Dive Professionals
EFR training, including Emergency Oxygen Provider education, is commonly undertaken by:
- Recreational divers seeking increased safety awareness
- Rescue Diver candidates
- Divemasters and instructors
- Dive center staff and boat crew

EFR training supports preparedness across recreational and professional diving activities.

---

## Limitations and Boundaries
EFR training:
- Does not qualify individuals to provide medical diagnosis or treatment
- Does not replace emergency medical services
- Is intended to support immediate response until professional help is available

Participants are expected to operate within the scope of their training and local regulations.

---

## Summary
EFR training integrates emergency care principles into the diving environment by supporting diver safety, Rescue Diver preparation, and accident response awareness. Emergency Oxygen Provider education further complements this role by addressing oxygen use in diving-related incidents within a structured first response framework.
