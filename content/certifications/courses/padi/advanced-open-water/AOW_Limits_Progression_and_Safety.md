# AOW_Limits_Progression_and_Safety
**PADI Advanced Open Water Diver Certification**

## Depth Limits
The Advanced Open Water Diver certification expands recommended depth limits based on additional training and supervised experience.

### Maximum Depth Limits
- **Adults (15+)**: 30 meters / 100 feet
- **Junior Advanced Open Water Diver (ages 12–14)**: 21 meters / 70 feet with a certified adult

These limits are based on training exposure completed during the course.

---

## Junior Advanced Open Water Diver Considerations
Divers aged 12–14 earn the Junior Advanced Open Water Diver certification, which includes:
- Reduced maximum depth limits
- Requirement to dive with a certified adult
- Automatic upgrade to full Advanced Open Water Diver certification at age 15

---

## Experience and Responsibility
The Advanced Open Water Diver certification emphasizes experience-building through supervised adventure dives. Certification indicates completion of training, not accumulated experience.

Divers are expected to:
- Dive within training limits
- Apply skills learned during adventure dives
- Continue building experience gradually

---

## Post-Certification Diving Considerations
After certification, Advanced Open Water Divers may:
- Access dive sites that require an advanced-level certification
- Participate in liveaboard diving trips where AOW is a minimum requirement
- Dive with a certified buddy within training limits

Dive operators may require refresher or checkout dives if a diver has not been active recently.

---

## Progression to Further Training
After earning the Advanced Open Water Diver certification, divers may continue their training through:

### Rescue Diver
- Focuses on dive safety, self-rescue, and assisting other divers
- Advanced Open Water Diver is a prerequisite

### Specialty Diver Courses
- Deep Diver (extends depth limits beyond 30 meters)
- Wreck Diver
- Underwater Navigator
- Peak Performance Buoyancy
- Enriched Air Nitrox

Adventure dives completed during AOW may count toward corresponding specialty certifications.

### Professional Training Path
- Advanced Open Water Diver is part of the prerequisite pathway toward professional-level certifications such as Divemaster

---

## Summary
The Advanced Open Water Diver certification establishes expanded depth limits, increased access to advanced dive sites, and a clear pathway to further recreational and professional training. Safe diving depends on staying within training limits, maintaining situational awareness, and continuing education.
