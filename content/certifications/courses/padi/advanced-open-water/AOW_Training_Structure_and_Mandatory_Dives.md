## Knowledge Development
Knowledge development is completed through self-study and is directly linked to each adventure dive.

### Format
- Self-study using eLearning, printed materials, or digital manuals
- Knowledge reviews for each adventure dive
- No final written exam

### Topics Covered
- Thinking Like a Diver (situational awareness, dive planning, gas management, problem-solving)
- Deep diving principles and physiological effects
- Underwater navigation techniques
- Specialty-specific knowledge related to selected adventure dives

---

## Adventure Dives Overview
The course includes **five open water adventure dives** conducted under instructor supervision.

### Required Adventure Dives
Two adventure dives are mandatory:
