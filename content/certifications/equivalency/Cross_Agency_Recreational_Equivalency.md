# Cross_Agency_Recreational_Equivalency

**Cross-agency equivalency guide for recreational prerequisites (PADI reference)**

## Purpose

This document summarizes recreational-level equivalencies between common scuba training agencies and the closest PADI equivalents. It is intended to support **prerequisite checks** and **pathway navigation** (e.g., determining which PADI course a diver can take next based on an existing certification from another agency).

---

## Key Notes

- Cross-agency recognition typically applies to **meeting prerequisites for continuing education**, not issuing a new certification card.
- Equivalencies are based on agencies following **WRSTC-aligned standards**.
- For questions about training content, standards, or skills, refer to the **original issuing agency** and the **current PADI course requirements**.

## What “Equivalent” Usually Means (Practical Interpretation)

When a certification is considered “equivalent” for recreational levels, it generally means a diver may:

- Enroll in the **next** PADI course that lists the PADI equivalent as a prerequisite (e.g., a diver with “SSI Open Water Diver” may enroll in courses requiring “PADI Open Water Diver” as a prerequisite).
- Be accepted by dive operators as having comparable entry-level or advanced-level recreational training.

This does **not** automatically mean:

- A diver receives a PADI certification card without completing the PADI course.
- A diver is trained for all environments or specialties associated with the equivalent level.

---

## Crossover Process (Recreational)

- Divers may enroll in the next-level PADI course using an equivalent certification as a prerequisite (example: an SSI AOW diver may take PADI Rescue Diver if other prerequisites are met).
- Divers do not automatically receive equivalent PADI certification cards unless they complete the PADI course.

---

## Master Scuba Diver (MSD) Note

Only **PADI-issued specialty certifications** count toward the five specialty certifications required for the **PADI Master Scuba Diver** rating.

---

## Summary

Cross-agency equivalency supports prerequisite validation and pathway navigation for recreational scuba training. Always confirm prerequisites and any additional requirements with the training provider and current course standards.
