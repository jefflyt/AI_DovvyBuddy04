# comparison
**Agency comparison and mapping notes (RAG template)**

## Purpose
This document is a **comparison scaffold** to help structure cross-agency questions (e.g., “PADI vs SSI”) in a way that is safe for retrieval and avoids overclaiming.

It is intentionally conservative and should be populated only with **verifiable, source-cited facts** from official agency materials.

---

## Supported Agencies (Planned)
- PADI
- SSI
- NAUI
- CMAS
- BSAC

---

## Comparison Dimensions (Populate With Sources)
### Certification Ladder (Recreational)
- Entry experiences
- Entry-level certification
- Advanced recreational certification
- Rescue-level certification
- Recognition ratings (e.g., “Master” ratings)

### Depth Limits and Supervision Rules
- Junior age bands and supervision requirements
- Recommended/qualified depth limits by level

### Course Structure (High-level)
- Typical components (theory / confined water / open water)
- Typical number of dives/sessions

### Digital Verification
- Whether the agency supports digital cards and verification

### Cross-Agency Recognition
- WRSTC membership / alignment
- How prerequisites are accepted across agencies

---

## RAG Guardrails
- Do not imply two certifications are identical beyond **prerequisite equivalency**.
- Do not claim current pricing, availability, or standards without a dated, authoritative source.
- Prefer agency-published standards pages over blogs.
- If a user’s question is about what they personally should do next, respond with:
  - The prerequisite mapping (if known)
  - A request to verify with the dive center/instructor for current standards

---

## Current Content Status
- PADI equivalency table: present in `Cross_Agency_Recreational_Equivalency.md`
- SSI/NAUI/CMAS/BSAC official sourcing: **not yet added** (research required)

---

## Next Research Tasks (to complete this file)
- SSI recreational pathway and depth limits (official)
- NAUI recreational pathway and depth limits (official)
- CMAS star system definitions (official)
- BSAC Ocean/Sport/Dive Leader definitions (official)
- WRSTC member lists / standards references

Populate each section with short, source-backed bullets only.
