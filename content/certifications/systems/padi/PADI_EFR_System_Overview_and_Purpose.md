# EFR System Overview and Purpose
**Emergency First Response (EFR)**

## What Is Emergency First Response (EFR)
Emergency First Response (EFR) is an internationally recognized emergency care training system focused on **primary and secondary emergency response skills**. It is designed to teach participants how to respond to medical emergencies in everyday life, both in and out of the water.

EFR courses are **performance-based**, emphasizing practical skills and confidence rather than academic testing.

---

## Relationship to PADI
Emergency First Response is an **affiliate organization of PADI**. While EFR courses are not scuba certifications, they are integrated into the PADI training system as a required component for advanced diver education and professional development.

EFR training is a prerequisite for several PADI courses, including:
- Rescue Diver
- Divemaster
- Instructor-level certifications

---

## Who EFR Is For
EFR training is designed for:
- **Divers and non-divers**
- Individuals with no prior medical training
- Families, caregivers, and workplace participants
- Divers preparing for Rescue Diver or professional-level training

No prior experience is required to participate in EFR courses.

---

## Training Philosophy
EFR courses are built on the following principles:
- **Performance-based learning**: Participants demonstrate skills rather than pass written exams
- **Scenario-driven training**: Skills are practiced in realistic emergency situations
- **Care at the scene**: Focus on immediate response until professional medical care is available
- **Accessibility**: Training is suitable for adults and children (course-dependent)

---

## International Alignment
EFR training is developed in alignment with internationally recognized emergency care guidelines, including standards promoted by the **International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR)**.

Course content is updated periodically to reflect changes in emergency care guidelines.

---

## Recognition and Use
EFR certifications are:
- **Globally recognized**
- Accepted as valid emergency care training by dive centers and instructors
- Commonly accepted as equivalent to other CPR and first aid certifications for diving prerequisites

Acceptance outside of diving (e.g., workplace or regulatory requirements) depends on local regulations and employer policies.

---

## Summary
Emergency First Response provides accessible, globally recognized emergency care training for divers and non-divers. As a performance-based system aligned with international guidelines, EFR plays a critical role in diver safety education and serves as a prerequisite for advanced and professional PADI training.
