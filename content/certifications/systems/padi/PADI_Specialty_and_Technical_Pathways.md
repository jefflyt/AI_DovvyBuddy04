## Technical Diving (TecRec) Pathway

PADI TecRec programs extend diving beyond recreational limits, training divers for decompression diving, extended range, and advanced gas use.

### Technical Diving Levels

- **Tec Basics**: Introductory exposure to technical equipment and procedures
- **Tec 40 Diver**: Entry-level technical diving with limited decompression
- **Tec 45 Diver**: Deeper technical diving with extended decompression
- **Tec 50 Diver (Tec Deep Diver)**: Advanced technical diving to greater depths
- **Tec Trimix Levels**: Use of trimix gases for deeper technical diving

Technical diving requires additional equipment, experience, and adherence to specialized procedures.

## Rebreather Diving Certifications

PADI offers rebreather diving certifications for recreational and technical applications.

### Rebreather Programs

- **Rebreather Diver (Type R)**: Recreational rebreather diving within no-decompression limits
- **Advanced Rebreather Diver**: Extended depth and capability using bailout systems
- **Technical CCR Programs**: Closed-circuit rebreather training for technical diving depths

Rebreather certifications are equipment-specific and require dedicated training.

## Freediving Certifications

Freediving certifications are offered separately from scuba programs and focus on breath-hold diving.

### Freediving Levels

- **PADI Freediver**
- **PADI Advanced Freediver**
- **PADI Master Freediver**

These programs emphasize breath-hold techniques, safety procedures, and performance development.

## Summary

PADI specialty and technical pathways provide opportunities for divers to expand their skills beyond standard recreational diving. These programs support specialization, advanced environments, and alternative diving disciplines while remaining integrated within the broader PADI certification system.
