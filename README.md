# AI-Driven Development Workflow

This repository is configured for **AI‑assisted software development** using GitHub Copilot in **Plan Mode** together with a set of powerful custom prompts.

The design of this repo enables a structured, reliable, and repeatable development pipeline:

```text
PSD → Master Plan → Feature Plan → PR Plan → Implementation → Refactor
```

This README explains how to use the repo and the provided prompt files.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```text
.github/
  prompts/                 # All custom prompts (run using / commands in Copilot)
  copilot-instructions.md  # Optional global rules for Copilot behavior

docs/
  psd/                     # Product Specification Documents (created via /psd)
  plans/                   # Master plan + feature‑level plans
  references/              # API docs, glossary, schemas, integrations
  decisions/               # Architecture decision records (ADRs)

plans/                     # PR-level execution plans generated by /plan-refactored + /generate

src/
  backend/                 # Backend application code
  frontend/                # Frontend application code
  shared/                  # Shared utilities, models, helpers
  tests/                   # Unit + integration tests

AI_WORKFLOW.md             # Full workflow guide (required reading)
README.md                 # This file
init_ai_workflow.sh        # Script to scaffold the required structure
```

The separation of **docs**, **plans**, and **src** is intentional:

- `docs/` → planning and specifications  
- `plans/` → implementation instructions  
- `src/` → actual code

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install & Open in VS Code

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd AI-Driven_Development_Workflow
```

Open in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

Make sure GitHub Copilot Chat (Plan mode) is enabled.

---

## 🧠 Workflow Overview (High-Level)

1. **Create PSD**  
2. **Generate Master Plan**  
3. **Plan Each Feature**  
4. **Turn Feature Plan → PR Plan**  
5. **Generate Implementation Substeps**  
6. **Implement Real Code**  
7. **Refactor When Needed**

Each step is performed via a slash command in VS Code Copilot Chat.

---

## 🛠 Available Commands

These commands come from the files in `.github/prompts/`.

### 1. `/psd` — Create Product Specification Document

Creates a complete PSD from a high‑level idea.  
Save the output into:

```text
docs/psd/<product>.psd.md
```

---

### 2. `/plan` — Generate Master Implementation Plan

Uses your PSD to create the overall architecture + roadmap.  
Save to:

```text
docs/plans/master_plan.md
```

---

### 3. `/plan_feature` — Create Feature‑Level Plans

Run this for each major feature.  
Save each feature plan under:

```text
docs/plans/<feature-name>/plan.md
```

---

### 4. `/plan-refactored` — Convert Feature Plan → PR Plan

Creates a single‑PR development plan for implementing one feature.  
Save under:

```text
plans/<feature-name>/plan.md
plans/<feature-name>/README.md
```

---

### 5. `/generate` — Generate Implementation Substep Documentation

Given a PR plan, generates:

```text
plans/<feature-name>/<step>/
  <step>.<substep>.md
```

Each file contains copy‑paste‑ready code instructions.

---

### 6. `/implement` — Write Real Code into `src/`

Executes the PR plan step-by-step.  
Creates or modifies code directly in your source tree.

You should:

- Review diffs  
- Run tests  
- Commit after each major step

---

### 7. `/refactor` — Create a Refactor Plan

Produces a refactor‑only plan for selected modules.  
(Does NOT generate code; planning only.)

---

### 8. `/search_docs` — Search Documentation

Searches `docs/` and code for matching information.  
Useful for consistency and reducing hallucination.

---

## 🔁 Typical Workflow Example

```text
/psd "Build JeffOS MCP — AI‑driven productivity OS"

/plan "Use PSD to create master plan"

/plan_feature "Google Calendar Integration"

/plan-refactored "Convert feature plan into PR plan"

/generate "Generate implementation docs for Google Calendar feature"

/implement "Implement the PR plan into src/"

/refactor "Create a refactor plan for backend sync modules"
```

Follow the order. Do not skip steps.

---

## ⚠️ Important Rules

- **Always use Plan Mode**  
  Agent mode breaks the workflow.

- **Never mix planning and code**  
  Plans live in `docs/` and `plans/`  
  Code lives in `src/`

- **One feature = one PR plan**

- **Keep PSD + docs updated**  
  Copilot accuracy depends heavily on documentation clarity.

---

## 🏁 Final Notes

This repository is optimized for:

- high‑quality AI‑assisted engineering  
- predictable and repeatable output  
- minimal developer guesswork  
- maximum PM‑to‑AI translation clarity

If you follow the workflow inside `AI_WORKFLOW.md`, you can reliably generate entire feature implementations with minimal manual coding work.

Happy building 🚀
